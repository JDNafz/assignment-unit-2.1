// REQUIRED FEATURES:
// 1 - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name
let firstName = "JD";
console.log("firstName is " + firstName);

// 2 - Create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name
let lastName = "Nafziger";
console.log("lastName is " + lastName);

// 3 - Create a third variable called `fullName`, assign it the value of your first and last name
// (remember, you already have variables for this, can you use those?)
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log("fullName is " + fullName);

// 4 - Console log the value of `fullName`
console.log(fullName);

// 5 - Create a variable called `luckyNumber` and assign it the value of your lucky number.
let luckyNumber = 13

// 6 - Console log this sentence, adding in the variables you created above: 
// 'My name is (full name), and I think (lucky number) is a winner!'.
// Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.
console.log("My name is " + fullName + ", and I think " + luckyNumber + " is a winner!");

// 7 - Create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)
let adventurous = true;

// 8 - Create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food
let food = "bacon";

// 9 - Create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have
let pets = 0;
console.log("pets:" + pets);
// 10 - Create a variable called `friendsPets` and assign it the value of the number of pets your friend has
let friendsPets = 3; // Alison has three cats

// 11 - Add two pets to your `pets` variable
pets += 2;
console.log("did pets increment by two? pets is now:" + pets);

// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice
let allowedPets = 5;

// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!", 
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"

// this line was used to test the conditional statement and check if the false scenario works.
// adventurous = false; 

// The conditional statement could also be completed without an equals operator like so:
// if (adventurous) {
if (adventurous === true) {
    console.log("Adventures are great!");
} else {
    // console.log("LOOK HERE DID IT WORK?????")
    console.log("How about we stay home?");
}

// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if luckyNumber is 2 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Roll the dice!"
if (luckyNumber === 2 && adventurous){
    console.log("Roll the dice!");
}


// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!" 
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.

if (pets < allowedPets){
    console.log("I can have more pets!");
} else if (pets == allowedPets){
    console.log("I have enough pets");
} else if (pets > allowedPets){
    console.log("Oh no, I have too many pets!");
} else {
    console.log("Uh oh, I did something unexpected/wrong");
}


// STRETCH GOALS:

// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios. 
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.

let mostPets = 0;
if (pets >= friendsPets){ // if pets and friendsPets are equal, it shouldn't matter which value gets assigned to mostPets
    mostPets = pets;
} else {
    mostPets = friendsPets;
}
console.log("mostPets:" + mostPets);



// 17 - Write a *switch* statement that logs:
//      "First is the worst" if your lucky number is 1
//      "Second is the best" if your lucky number is 2
//      "Third is the one with the polka dot dress" if your lucky number is 3
//      Otherwise, log "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity"
//      You'll need to research how to use switch statements!

//I made it into a function to test all the cases without having to re-write the switch statement
function luckyNumberCheck(selectedNumber){
    switch(selectedNumber){
        case 1: 
            console.log("First is the worst");
            break;
        case 2:
            console.log("Second is the best");
            break;
        case 3:
            console.log("Third is the one with the polka dot dress");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity");
            break;
    };
};
luckyNumberCheck(luckyNumber);
luckyNumberCheck(3);
luckyNumberCheck(2);
luckyNumberCheck(1);

// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!
    // 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!", 
    // if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"
    /* 
    
    if (adventurous) {
         console.log("Adventures are great!");
    } else {
         console.log("How about we stay home?");
    } */
console.log("adventurous is set to:" + adventurous + ". Next line uses a ternary operator inside of the console.log()");

console.log(adventurous ? "Adventures are great!" : "How about we stay home?");

console.log("same thing, but now adventurous is set to false:")
adventurous = false;

console.log(adventurous ? "Adventures are great!" : "How about we stay home?");
